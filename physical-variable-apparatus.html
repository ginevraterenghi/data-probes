        <summary>The sets of symptom and physical-variable labels</summary>
        <div class="variables-text">
          At the core of the apparatus are two interconnected sets of labels that mediate between
          experience, language, and material engagement. One set describes symptoms, making embodied
          experiences explicit and communicable. The other describes physical variables, providing a shared
          vocabulary through which these experiences can be translated into tangible and discussable forms.
          I developed these label sets through continuous dialogue between theory and practice,
          combining insights from the literature with the situated knowledge that emerged during the
          workshops. Each set contributes to the processes of eliciting, expressing, and negotiating
          embodied data within participatory settings. Their interaction allows participants to connect
          sensory perception with shared meaning-making, grounding knowledge generation in both
          material and discursive practice.
          I conceived the apparatus as an evolving tool that invites ongoing refinement through continued
          use. For this reason, the labels are available as both printable and digital resources, which can be
          customised and prepared for participatory activities. This format enables researchers, educators,
          and designers to adapt terminology, and reflects my intention to support collaborative and
          context-responsive engagement. In doing so, the format supports collaboration and collective
          authorship while ensuring that the vocabulary remains situated, flexible, and responsive to context.
        </div>


        <details class="drawer-labels-details">
          <summary class="drawer-labels-summary">Labels of symptoms</summary>
          <div class="variables-text nested-drawer-content">
            The first set consists of the labels describing symptoms of UTI. I selected these labels through
            a two-step process. A preliminary list was developed from medical literature to include the
            most commonly recognised symptoms, providing an evidence-based foundation and ensuring
            comprehensive coverage of the condition. This list was then introduced in the participatory setting,
            where participants described their own experiences of the illness and suggested additional terms.
            The combination of medical terminology and personal accounts enabled a shared understanding
            of what was being discussed and ensured that the resulting vocabulary integrated clinical sources
            with lived experience.
            <h4 class="chapter-7-title">What is considered as symptom</h4>
            <p>What is considered a symptom within this set of labels aligns with, yet also expands upon, the
              definition discussed in the theoretical ground of this thesis (Chapter 2), where symptoms are
              described as subjective manifestations of underlying physiological processes that rely on an
              individual’s ability to perceive and communicate internal sensations (Malterud et al., 2015). While
              the definition adopted in this thesis is intentionally broad and open to include psychological as well
              as physical conditions, the lists of UTI symptoms provided in the medical literature mainly refer
              to physical manifestations. This focus possibly reflects the clinical need to identify measurable
              indicators that support diagnosis and treatment. However, evidence from the workshops shows
              that participants rarely described symptoms as purely physiological events. Instead, symptoms
              were portrayed as felt conditions indicating change, discomfort, or imbalance, often intertwined
              with emotional states and contextual circumstances. Participants spoke of pressure, burning, and
              tension together with feelings of anxiety, inhibition, or embarrassment. These accounts reveal that
              symptoms are experienced as multidimensional phenomena, shaped by the interplay of physical,
              emotional, and social dimensions, and cannot be fully represented within the boundaries of medical
              terminology, which tends to isolate symptoms from the circumstances in which they are lived.
            </p>
            <p>Based on this, I broaden the definition of symptom to recognise how causes, effects, and
              experiences overlap in the progression and understanding of disease. Clinical reasoning
              often relies on a linear model in which disease produces symptoms and symptoms lead to
              consequences or complications. When illness is examined through lived experience, these
              categories become less distinct. What medicine may classify as a consequence or external
              factor can instead contribute to shaping or intensifying the condition itself. Acknowledging these
              interdependencies allows a more comprehensive view of illness, where physical, emotional, and
              contextual factors work together in producing the experience of being unwell. This perspective
              shows that what sustains or worsens a symptom may not reside only in the body but may also
              relate to emotional states, social interactions, or environmental circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>By moving beyond temporal and hierarchical models of cause and effect, this thesis adopts a
              holistic and relational understanding of symptoms. Within this context, symptoms are considered
              as changes in the body that become meaningful through perception, expression, and shared
              interpretation, functioning as traces that connect awareness with processes of meaning-making.
              This expanded understanding opens a space for deeper dialogue about disease and invites reflection on how
              its mechanisms are experienced, interpreted, and potentially transformed. Based
              on this interpretation, the following section presents the list of symptoms considered meaningful
              for the activity, combining physical conditions from the literature and alternative descriptions and
              perceptions emerged from the workshop sessions.
              The set should not be treated as a definitive or exhaustive list, but as a resource that can be
              taken up, questioned, and adapted in future activities. Its role is to provide an orientation that
              supports discussion, making space for further articulation of embodied conditions across different
              contexts.</p>
            <h4 class="chapter-7-title">The final list of symptoms considered for the labels</h4>
            <p>The initial set of symptoms, which was also adopted during the activities as the formal reference
              for the labels, was extracted from the medical literature (Kaur and Kaur, 2020) and includes the
              following:
            </p>

            <ul class="variables-text three-column-list">
              <li>~ <strong>Swollen stomach</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Cloudy urine</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Cloody urine</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Need to pee</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Pain when peeing</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Discomfort when peeing</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Low temperature below 36</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Pressure in the groin</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Lower abdomen cramping</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Lower back pain</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Side pain</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Shivering</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Unable to empty the bladder fully</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Incontinence</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Vomiting</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Nausea</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Tiredness</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Aching</strong>;</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Foul-smelling urine</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            Building on the initial list drawn from the literature, additional elements emerged during the study
            and added in the final set of labels. They are organised to reflect a continuum that connects
            physical manifestations with psychological and emotional dimensions of the experience. For
            every symptom, a description is provided, which summarises the different explanations given by
            participants and situates them within the context of this specific condition.

            <ul class="variables-text">
              <li>~ <strong>Bloated stomach</strong>: Internal sensation of fullness and pressure in the lower abdomen,
                often
                associated with swelling or incontinence. It expresses a feeling of expansion and imbalance,
                where the body is perceived as heavy or distended. The symptom conveys tension and
                retention, marking the early stage of discomfort and loss of bodily ease.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Burning when urinating</strong>: A sharp or stinging pain during urination, often perceived
                as
                heat or
                irritation in the urinary tract. It indicates inflammation of the bladder or urethra and represents a
                distinct sensory marker of infection, characterised by discomfort and heightened sensitivity.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Tension</strong>: Muscular or psychological contraction arising from discomfort, stress, or
                anticipation
                of pain. It manifests as bodily stiffness or rigidity and reflects the connection between emotional
                strain and physical response. The symptom expresses how anxiety or worry can translate into a
                felt tightness within the body, linking emotional experience to somatic reaction.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Internal heat / ‘Burning aura’</strong>: Diffuse sensation of warmth or heat inside the
                pelvic
                area, often
                radiating beyond the point of pain. It conveys inflammation and internal irritation perceived
                through thermal imagery such as fire or glow. The symptom reflects an intensified bodily
                awareness, where heat becomes a sign of disturbance and imbalance within the body.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Swelling / Internal pressure</strong>: Sensation of heaviness, fullness, or expansion in the
                lower
                abdomen or pelvic area. It often precedes pain and signals the onset or progression of infection.
                The symptom expresses an awareness of internal build-up or obstruction, where the body is felt
                dense and strained, indicating a loss of fluid balance and comfort.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Dryness</strong>: Lack of moisture or smoothness within the urinary tract, perceived as
                friction or
                roughness during urination. It conveys a sense of abrasion and discomfort, often preceding
                or accompanying pain. The symptom reflects a surface-level sensitivity, where the body is
                experienced as raw or unprotected.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Irritation</strong>: Burning or stinging sensation caused by inflammation or repeated
                friction
                in the
                urinary tract. It conveys a feeling of persistent sensitivity and discomfort, often fluctuating
                in intensity. The symptom reflects the reactive state of the body when exposed to infection,
                marking heightened awareness of pain and vulnerability.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Anxiety</strong>: State of unease or apprehension related to the anticipation of pain or
                recurrence of
                infection. It manifests as mental tension and restlessness, often influencing bodily sensations
                and perception of symptoms. The symptom reflects a psychological response intertwined with
                physical experience, showing how fear and uncertainty become part of the illness itself.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Feeling of instability</strong>: Sense of imbalance or loss of steadiness that accompanies
                repeated or
                unpredictable illness episodes. It conveys both physical fragility and emotional insecurity, as
                the body is perceived as unreliable or easily disturbed. The symptom reflects the progressive
                weakening of confidence in bodily control, linking recurrence with feelings of uncertainty and
                loss of grounding.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Vulnerability / Shame</strong>: Feeling of exposure, fragility, and discomfort connected to
                the private
                nature of urinary symptoms. It arises from the difficulty of discussing intimate or stigmatised
                conditions, often accompanied by embarrassment or self-consciousness. The symptom
                expresses a social and emotional dimension of illness, where bodily sensitivity is intensified by
                cultural silence and fear of judgment.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Uncertainty in feeling perceptions</strong>: Difficulty in recognising or interpreting
                bodily
                sensations,
                such as distinguishing normal from abnormal discomfort. It reflects a state of doubt toward
                one’s own perception, often emerging when symptoms are ambiguous or fluctuate in intensity.
                The symptom reveals the fragility of bodily knowledge, showing how individuals question their
                sensations and rely on reflection or comparison to make sense of what they feel.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Fatigue</strong>: Persistent sense of physical and mental exhaustion that follows or
                accompanies
                infection. It extends beyond ordinary tiredness, affecting concentration, motivation, and daily
                activities. The symptom reflects the prolonged impact of illness on the body’s energy and
                emotional balance, marking a continuous drain that blurs recovery and recurrence.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Sexual inhibition</strong>: Reluctance or fear of engaging in sexual activity due to pain,
                discomfort,
                or anxiety related to infection. It reflects how the illness affects intimacy, trust, and body
                confidence, often leading to avoidance or emotional distance. The symptom reveals the
                relational consequences of vulnerability, where physical sensitivity and psychological fear
                combine to limit sexual expression and connection.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Overwhelming</strong>: State of unease or apprehension related to the anticipation of pain
                or
                recurrence
                of infection. It manifests as mental tension and restlessness, often influencing bodily sensations
                and perception of symptoms. The symptom reflects a psychological response intertwined with
                physical experience, showing how fear and uncertainty become part of the illness itself.</li>

          <div class="variables-text">
            To complement the set of symptoms, the physical-variable labels introduce a material vocabulary
            that enables participants to externalise their experiences into tangible forms. Each variable
            corresponds to a perceptual dimension, such as texture, weight, temperature, elasticity, or shape,
            that participants can explore through direct interaction with materials. These variables translate
            intimate sensations into visible and tactile expressions that can be collectively discussed, allowing
            the subjective experience of illness to be materialised and shared.
            <p>The development of the set of physical variables combines theoretical grounding with
              participatory experimentation. The framework proposed by Hornecker et al. (2023) provided the
              initial foundation for identifying relevant sensory dimensions, as it analyses how material properties
              operate as variables in the creation of meaning when materials are used for data representation.
              While the classification proposed by Hornecker and colleagues was comprehensive, only a
              limited selection of variables was introduced during the first workshop sessions to maintain clarity
              and focus. In subsequent sessions, participants spontaneously referred to additional sensory
              properties that had not been part of the initial selection. Their repeated mention of these variables
              confirmed their relevance and led to their inclusion in the final version of the set. During these
              same workshops, participants also identified new variables that were not present in Hornecker’s
              classification but were recognised as meaningful to describe their embodied experiences.</p>
            <p>Although Hornecker et al. (2023) distinguish between explicit variables, implicit properties, and
              consequential aspects, I chose to treat these dimensions as free from categorical divisions. I
              made this decision because the purpose is not to reproduce an existing taxonomy but to enable
              open exploration and intuitive association. Since participants are supposedly not familiar with
              the terminology of physical variables or with material properties more broadly, introducing further
              classification is expected to create confusion and distance them from the experiential focus of the
              activity. For this reason, overlapping dimensions are not repeated, and the variables are presented
              without hierarchical order.</p>
            <h3 class="chapter-7-title">The final list of physical variables considered for the labels</h3>
            The list of physical variables considered in this study draws from the vocabulary established by
            Hornecker et al. (2023), which includes:

              <li>~ <strong>Hardness</strong>: Perception of rigidity or resistance that evokes pain or lack of comfort.
                It reflects
                sensations that feel invasive or unyielding, representing difficulty in relief or transformation. The
                variable conveys the perception of the body as stiff or constrained, mirroring persistence and
                strain.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Density</strong>: Sense of compactness or saturation that expresses heaviness and fatigue.
                It conveys
                the perception of the body as weighty or full, suggesting reduced mobility and energy. The
                variable represents the bodily experience of accumulation and tiredness.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Amount</strong>: Perception of numerical repetition or frequency used to represent
                recurrence
                or
                intensity. It expresses how symptoms or sensations repeat, multiply, or accumulate. The variable

              <li>~ <strong>Integrity</strong>: Perception of wholeness or fragmentation in a material or form. It
                reflects conditions of
                breakdown, fragility, or deformation, symbolising vulnerability and loss of cohesion. The variable
                represents how the body or its sensations are perceived as intact, damaged, or altered through
                the course of illness.</li>

            Through the participatory workshops, several new variables emerged that were not explicitly
            included in the existing classifications but were considered relevant for future applications of the
            apparatus. These additions reflect participants’ interpretations of their embodied experiences and
            illustrate how new forms of material expression can arise through collaborative exploration. These
            new variables are accompanied with descriptions that illustrate how each was used and interpreted
            by participants, explaining how material features gained meaning within the context of this intimate
            condition.
            <ul class="variables-text">
              <li>~ <strong>Elasticity</strong>: Sensed capacity to expand or contract, expressed as tension, fullness,
                or
                distortion. It
                represents how inner pressure and change of volume can indicate the transition from stability to
                discomfort. The variable conveys the perception of expansion or compression as an indicator of
                disturbance and altered bodily awareness.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Sharpness</strong>: Perception of pointed or angular surface qualities that evoke
                irritation,
                pain, or
                intensity. It reflects how edges and spikes can symbolise sensations of cutting, piercing, or
                burning. The variable expresses the felt acuteness of discomfort through geometrical and tactile
                associations.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Pressure</strong>: Sensation of internal force or weight within the body, linked to cramps,
                tightness, or
                urgency. It conveys the dominance of compression and density in the experience of illness. The
                variable represents the internal build-up that marks the body’s response to inflammation and
                discomfort.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Permeability</strong>: Degree to which a material or body allows substances to pass through
                or
                remain contained. It symbolises conditions such as leakage, filtering, or retention. The variable
                represents the body’s openness or closure, expressing experiences of flow, blockage, or
                imbalance.</li>
              <li>~ <strong>Durability</strong>: Sensation of persistence or duration of a symptom, ranging from
                fleeting
                sensations
                to chronic or recurring ones. The variable expresses how long discomfort is perceived to last and
                how it lingers within bodily awareness, revealing the temporal aspect of endurance and recovery.</li>

          <h3 class="chapter-7-title">Labels as Figma components</h3>
          To remain consistent with the notion of the apparatus drawn from Barad (2007), this thesis positions
          the labels not as fixed outputs but as material resources to be taken up, adapted, and reconfigured
          beyond the specific use for which they were originally designed. The apparatus is conceived as
          a material-discursive arrangement that must remain responsive to different contexts of enquiry.
          For this reason, I make the labels available primarily as Figma components (Figure 7.1). Figma is a
          collaborative interface design tool where components function as reusable elements that maintain
          a consistent structure while allowing for specific variations. By providing the labels as components,
          I ensure that the apparatus allows future researchers to act directly on the tools. Users can modify
          the master component to change the shape or style of all labels simultaneously, or interact with
          individual instances to override text and content. This functionality is essential for the adaptability
          of the method, as it allows researchers to rename existing labels or add new elements to
          accommodate symptoms emerging from future interactions or to address different diseases with
          distinct symptomatologies. As demonstrated in the EKSIG workshop (see Section 7.6), the set of
          variables must be able to expand based on the focus of the work, such as the inclusion of sound, or
          the specific materials available in a given working environment.
          <p>The Figma format allows these new variables to be integrated seamlessly into the existing
            system, ensuring that the apparatus can evolve alongside the research questions it supports.
            Access to these components is provided through a public link (https://www.figma.com/community/
            file/1582302079862223061), maintaining alignment with the open and collaborative approach of this
            thesis. Detailed instructions are included within the file, guiding users on how to intervene, edit, and
            personalise the sets of labels to suit their specific needs.</p>
          <p>To ensure the apparatus remains accessible to researchers and practitioners outside the field
            of design, or those with limited access to design software, the labels are also made available in
            PDF format. While this format offers more restricted possibilities for intervention, such as limited
            editing of names or selection of specific portions for printing, it ensures that the tools remain usable
            for people with varying levels of design skill and technical resources. Both formats are hosted in
            a dedicated page on the online repository
            (https://ginevraterenghi.github.io/data-probes/physical-variable-
            apparatus.html) specifically developed to collect and make available the material of this thesis and
            further described in Section 7.5.</p>

          <h3 class="chapter-7-title">Summary of the sets of labels</h3>
          The two sets of labels (symptoms and physical variables) form the conceptual and operational
          foundation of the Apparatus. Together they establish a shared language that connects embodied
          experience with material expression, enabling participants to articulate sensations that are
          otherwise difficult to express. The symptom labels can be adapted to different health conditions,
          providing a flexible vocabulary that reflects the specific context of each activity. The physical-variable
          labels, by contrast, are designed to guide the process itself and constitute the core of the
          Apparatus. They structure how participants engage with materials, interpret their experiences, and
          communicate meaning collectively. As the first components of the Apparatus, the labels define
          the basis for participation and create the conditions through which embodied knowledge can be
          elicited, interpreted, and shared. The following components build on this foundation, expanding the
          Apparatus through the workshop protocol, the Data-Probes material kit, and the analytical interface
          that sustain its data collection and interpretation functions.

          <h3 class="chapter-7-title">The workshop protocol phases</h3>
          To present the protocol, I focus on the forms of engagement through which meaning emerges
          during the workshop. These phases derive directly from the observed dynamics of the sessions
          and describe the key interactions that shape participation. Rather than prescribing fixed steps, they
          outline the essential actions that structure how participants encounter the materials, the labels,
          and each other. Each phase is presented through four highlights, material, action, purpose, and
          outcome, which together clarify what is introduced, how participants engage with it, why it matters,
          and what it enables within the activity. By presenting the higlights instead of specific instructions on
          how to replicate the activity, this structure makes the protocol adaptable to different contexts while
          preserving the relational conditions with the context and material from which it generated.

          <h3 class="chapter-7-title">Summary of the protocol of engagement</h3>
          The protocol of engagement defines how participation unfolds within the Apparatus, guiding the
          transition from individual awareness to collective interpretation. Through a sequence of relational
          actions, participants move from identifying and discussing symptoms to exploring their material
          expression and sharing interpretations through artefact creation. Each phase connects linguistic,
          material, and social dimensions, showing how knowledge emerges through interaction rather than
          instruction. The protocol provides structure without imposing fixed procedures, allowing adaptation
          to different contexts while preserving the core dynamics of reflection, comparison, and dialogue
          that characterise the Apparatus. Building on these engagement dynamics, the following section
          introduces the criteria for material selection, informed by the Data-Probes. These materials provide
          the physical means through which participants translate sensations into tangible forms and sustain
          material reasoning at the centre of the activity.

        <summary>The Data-Probes material kit</summary>
        <div class="variables-text">
          The material kit represents the tangible dimension of this research methodology and served as one
          of its core operational components. Data-Probes provide the means through which participants
          translate sensations such as pain, tension, or pressure into physical and tactile forms. By engaging
          directly with matter, the components link sensory experiences with processes of reflection,
          interpretation, and collective knowledge production.
          The material kit I employed during the workshops includes triangular prisms, spheres, and
          cubes made of wood, polyester, and foam, as described in the Chapter 3. These components
          are deliberately chosen for their sensory diversity rather than for symbolic meaning. Their design,
          connected through small wooden pegs, encourages participants to join and separate pieces freely,
          exploring how relationships between materials and gestures could express different sensations
          and bodily experiences.
          Within the activity, the value of the kit lied in the experiences it enables. Engaging with materials
          that vary in texture, weight, and resistance allows participants to reason through touch, using
          manipulation and comparison as ways to reflect on their sensations. The components therefore
          function as stimuli that evoke contrast, movement, and interpretation. Within this perspective, the
          role of the kit in the Apparatus is not to prescribe which materials should be used but to establish
          the conditions for exploration. The following section introduces a set of principles for material
          selection and organisation, describing how future applications can identify and prepare materials
          that maintain the exploratory and interpretive qualities of this research.
          <h3 class="chapter-7-title">Principles for material selection and organisation</h3>
          Considering the purpose of the kit as a tool that I use to foster embodied reflection and collective
          enquiry, the following principles draw on insights from the workshops, visual research, and
          participant feedback to offer instructions for identifying and organising materials in future
          applications of this methodology. Each principle is articulated through a definition, a rationale,
          and a set of practical implications, followed by reflective questions intended to guide facilitators
          in selecting and adapting the kit to different contexts. This structure ensures that conceptual,
          empirical, and operational dimensions remain connected. The definition clarifies the theoretical
          meaning of the principle within the apparatus. The rationale draws from observations made during
          the workshops, showing how participants engaged with materials and how these interactions
          shaped processes of interpretation and meaning-making. The practical implications then transform
          these insights into concrete guidance for future applications of the apparatus. Finally, the reflective
          questions extend the principles into practical guide for facilitators who wish to develop or adapt
          their own material kit.
          By combining principles and reflective questions, this section transforms the choices behind
          the material selection into an adaptive design instrument to allow future researchers to sustain its
          epistemic focus on participation, materiality, and situated knowledge across diverse contexts.

              <li><strong>Rationale</strong>: During the workshops, participants made sense of their experiences by
                comparing
                materials with distinct tactile properties. They linked sensations such as pressure, burning, or
                instability to contrasts between softness and rigidity or between smooth and rough surfaces. This
                contrast stimulated reflection and articulation. This attitude also revealed that participants sought
                materials that evoked, rather than avoided, discomfort. Contrast therefore functions as the first layer
                of dialogue between perception and materiality.</li>
              <li><strong>Practical implications</strong>:
                <br>~ Include components which clearly convey different features;
                <br>~ Ensure that contrasts emerge from physical features first;
                <br>~ Consider that contrast extends beyond physical properties and invites emotional and symbolic

              <li><strong>Rationale</strong>: In the workshops, wooden pegs made it possible to connect geometric

                artefacts to evolve through manipulation. This process also transformed pegs from passive
                connectors into active constructors of meaning. Modularity thus supports participation by fostering

              <li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Participants expressed their sensations through movement, pressing,

        Together, these components establish the conditions through which participation, material
        engagement, and interpretation converge. To demonstrate the adaptability of the apparatus
        beyond the specific case of UTIs, the chapter concludes with an
        application developed for the EKSIG 2025 conference. This final application serves to validate the
        transferability of the apparatus and its capacity to incorporate new variables, such as sound and
        gesture, into the representation of embodied experience.

      </div>

      <div class="variables-text">
        <h2 class="chapter-7-title">Applications and relevance of the Apparatus</h2>
        <p>The Apparatus has been developed for researchers and practitioners working across design,
          health, and social enquiry. The aim is to provide a structured method for eliciting and interpreting
          embodied data, enabling forms of knowledge that conventional medical frameworks rarely capture.
          Clinical descriptions often detach symptoms from lived experience, overlooking the complexity
          of how individuals perceive and respond to illness. The apparatus addresses this limitation by
          introducing material engagement as a way to explore and communicate sensations that are
          difficult to express through language or standardised measurement. Through direct interaction with
          materials, participants give form to emotions and perceptions, transforming subjective experiences
          into artefacts that can be collectively observed, discussed, and interpreted. This process enables
          the emergence of shared understanding and supports dialogue around personal and collective
          dimensions of health.</p>
        <p>Evidence from the workshop sessions and expert validation interviews, which I discuss in
          Chapter 4 and 5, demonstrates the versatility of the approach. Although the research was initially
          developed to investigate experiences related to UTIs, it opened broader questions about how
          embodied experiences are articulated in healthcare. For this reason, the Apparatus is designed
          to extend beyond this specific case and to support enquiry across a wider range of contexts. It is
          particularly suited to chronic and recurring conditions, where patients’ perspectives are essential to
          complement clinical knowledge and bridge medical interpretation with personal experience.
          Beyond healthcare, the apparatus also serves as a resource for design researchers interested
          in participatory methods, material exploration, and alternative forms of data representation. The
          structure provides a systematic way to elicit, organise, and discuss subjective interpretations within
          collective settings, offering a methodological foundation for enquiry through making. Scholars in
          sociology and science and technology studies (STS) may likewise find value in the Apparatus as a
          tool for examining how illness, knowledge, and experience are enacted in practice. By translating
          theoretical discussions on knowledge, practice, and embodiment into a tangible participatory
          procedure, the apparatus fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between design, health, and the
          social sciences.</p>

        <h3 class="chapter-7-title">Functions of the Apparatus within participatory enquiry</h3>
        <p>The Apparatus functions as an inspirational system that guides participants in engaging,
          interpreting, and constructing meaning through material interaction. The function extends beyond
          the facilitation of expression by organising the conditions through which embodied data become
          observable, interpretable, and transformable into shared knowledge. The apparatus mediates
          between individual sensations and collective understanding, allowing private experiences to
          become communicable without reducing their complexity. Within this structure, three interrelated
          functions define its role in the participatory process:
        </p>
        <h4 class="chapter-7-title">1) Elicitation of embodied data</h4>
        <p>The Apparatus provides material means that help participants attend to and perceive their
          symptoms more clearly. Physical variables such as texture, weight, temperature, and elasticity
          offer contrasting sensory cues that prompt deeper awareness of how symptoms feel in the body.
          Engaging with materials encourages participants to sense, compare, and refine their perceptions
          through touch and movement. The Apparatus therefore acts as a perceptual scaffold, helping
          individuals recognise nuances in their bodily experiences that may otherwise remain vague or
          difficult to describe.</p>
        <h4 class="chapter-7-title">2) Structuring interpretation</h4>
        <p>Alongside perception, the Apparatus supports participants in making sense of their own embodied
          expressions. Mapping sensations onto physical variables encourages individuals to articulate why
          particular material qualities resonate with their experience. Through this interpretive engagement,
          participants clarify the links between sensation and representation, developing a more precise and
          reflective understanding of their own symptoms.</p>
        <h4 class="chapter-7-title">3) Generating collective knowledge</h4>
        <p>At the same time, the Apparatus enables individual interpretations to become part of a shared field
          of understanding. When participants present and compare their material representations, their
          contributions intersect, revealing similarities and differences across experiences. Tangible artefacts
          serve as common reference points through which perspectives can be compared, negotiated,
          and expanded. Through these exchanges, diverse interpretations become connected, forming
          a collective vocabulary that integrates emotional, physical, and social dimensions of experience.
          Meaning arises through the interplay of material and discursive practices, allowing individual
          insights to contribute to a broader and more inclusive body of knowledge.
          The following sections present the four interconnected components that constitute the
          Apparatus, which are the sets of labels, the workshop protocol for engagement, the Data-Probes
          material kit, and the cross-format analysis interface for analysis. Each of the components are
          described in relation to its role in enabling participation, material interaction, and collective
          knowledge generation.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-7-title">Application of the Apparatus beyond this
          thesis</h2>
        <p>I applied the apparatus for the first time beyond the doctoral research within the workshop Health
          Self-Revealed: Exploring Self-Narratives and Data Physicalization Practices Towards a Shared Design
          Vocabulary conducted during the EKSIG 2025 Conference in Budapest. EKSIG (‘Experiential
          Knowledge Special Interest Group’) is an international design research conference that focuses on
          how knowledge is generated through practice, experience, and material engagement. The detailed
          description of the activity is available from the proposal submitted with Sara Lenzi and currently
          uploaded to my Zenodo account (Terenghi and Lenzi, 2025). </p>
        <p>This setting provided an ideal context
          for me to extend the Apparatus and observe how it could operate among design researchers
          accustomed to reflective and process-based inquiry. Besides this, the workshop offered the
          occasion to collaborate with Dr Sara Lenzi, a designer and sound researcher whose expertise
          in sonification and auditory display guided the integration of sound into the activity. Lenzi’s work
          focuses on the use of sound as a medium for data communication and sensory inquiry, combining
          design practice with research on auditory perception and embodied experience (Lenzi et al.,
          2024). Her contribution provided a complementary perspective that allowed the Apparatus to be extended into
          the auditory domain. Figure 7.10 is taken from the introduction of the activity during the
          EKSIG Conference, at Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, on May 12th, 2025. The workshop
          focused on exploring sound as an autographic method for representing symptoms, building on
          insights from this thesis workshops in which participants recognised sonic qualities as meaningful
          extensions of material engagement (Section 4.7.1). Building on these insights, the activity developed
          for EKSIG investigated how sound can unfold from physical interaction with materials and how it
          can contribute to the communication of embodied sensations.</p>
        <p>Through this collaboration, the Apparatus was adapted to explore the relationship between
          touch, gesture, and auditory expression, expanding its scope beyond the original context while
          maintaining its methodological foundations.</p>

        <h3 class="chapter-7-title">Adaptation of the Apparatus</h3>
        <p>The workshop took place in person and lasted about three hours. Around fifteen participants,
          all with a background in design research and practice, took part in the activity. They were
          organised into three groups, each sharing a table equipped with stationery, printed labels, and a
          wide selection of materials chosen for their tactile and acoustic diversity. These included wood,
          polyester, foam, sandpaper, fabric, bamboo sticks, metal rods of different diameters (some ridged
          or concave), cardboard, metal spheres, sponge rubber, aluminium foil, a transparent PVC sheet,
          and a cork sheet. The materials were selected for the range of sounds they could produce and
          gathered according to their availability and ease of sourcing. The environment was kept informal to
          encourage discussion, experimentation, and collective listening.</p>
        <p>In this new context, the Apparatus retained its original purpose of supporting the externalisation
          of embodied experiences through participatory and material engagement, but its structure was
          adapted to the specific aim of the workshop. Since the activity sought to investigate the relationship
          between physical elements and sonification, a new set of sound variable labels was introduced
          to complement the existing physical ones. In parallel, gesture labels were incorporated to draw
          explicit attention to the actions through which sound emerges.
        </p>
        <p>The addition of gestures responded not only to the practical need of activating sound but also
          to insights from the analysis of previous workshops, where gesture had repeatedly surfaced
          as a crucial element in how participants interacted with materials and externalised sensations.
          While touching a texture or weighing a component often occurs naturally and is perceived as an
          integrated act of sensing, producing sound requires a more deliberate and physical engagement.
          The inclusion of these two new categories expanded the expressive range of the Apparatus,
          enabling participants to move between perception and action, and to explore how sound can
          emerge as a continuation of material interaction.</p>
        <p>The labels were printed in different colours (yellow, red, blue, and green) to help participants
          distinguish them easily and collaborate effectively. Their shape was intentionally designed to
          be bidirectional and open, allowing flexible connections and continuous rearrangement. This
          openness was essential because one of the main interests of the workshop was to examine the
          reciprocal relationship between material and sound, and how sound could inspire the selection of
          a material, and how the qualities of a material could in turn suggest or generate a sound. By leaving
          the structure open, participants were free to follow either pathway, encouraging exploration of the
          mutual influence between tactile and auditory perception. Figure 7.12 shows how the process of
          combining the labels was adapted and intended to work for this activity, while the material set-up is
          presented in Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.13.</p>
        <h4 class="chapter-7-title">Exploring material–sound relations through the Apparatus</h4>
        <p>Within the Health Self-Revealed workshop, the labels acted as mediators connecting perception,
          gesture, and collective interpretation. Participants selected and arranged symptom labels such
          as “tension,” “pressure,” or “instability,” and linked them with physical and sound variables like
          “vibration,” “rhythm,” or “texture.” This mapping process fostered a multimodal form of reasoning,
          where meaning emerged from the relations between elements rather than from individual
          associations. By linking each symptom to a sound and identifying the gesture needed to produce it,
          participants transformed personal sensations into shared expressions.</p>
        <p>As in the previous two workshop sessions (WS4 and WS5), the activity did not begin with a
          predefined disease. Instead, participants were given labels describing general symptoms and
          were asked, within each group, to agree on a condition to represent based on shared experience.
          Empty or modifiable labels were used to add or adapt symptoms that better reflected collective
          perception, rather than to expand medical knowledge of the condition. These additions served to
          establish a shared reference for expression and collaboration. No new physical or sound variables
          were introduced, as the existing set already offered a wide expressive range, particularly since
          physical and acoustic variables were presented as separate categories.</p>
        <p>This process confirmed the iterative nature of the apparatus and its capacity to support
          collective negotiation of meaning, allowing participants to align around common sensory
          interpretations rather than factual descriptions.</p>
        <p>Within this context, sound particular prompted participants to perceive symptoms as unfolding
          events rather than fixed conditions, emphasising their temporal and causal dimensions. In several
          cases, groups arranged symptoms along a timeline that moved from a state of health to one of
          illness, using acoustic features to mark transitions and relations. Smooth metal sticks, for example,
          produced an initiating sound described as “the beginning of an orchestra,” (Group 1) symbolising
          the onset of discomfort and the awareness that something had changed (Figure 7.14).
          The workshop also revealed how the spatial and visual form of the labels influenced cognitive
          and collaborative dynamics. Their connectable shape enabled both linear and non-linear
          arrangements, allowing groups to organise experiences as timelines, clusters, or body maps. When
          symptoms were represented as concurrent, for example, participants placed their labels in parallel
          rather than sequentially, forming rhythmic compositions instead of static arrangements (Figure 7.15).
          Through these actions, sonification encouraged exploration of how experiences develop, overlap,
          and evolve over time. This flexibility mirrored the Apparatus’s methodological openness and
          showed that its physical design can guide reasoning and foster alternative modes of knowledge
          formation.</p>
        <p>The integration of sonic and gestural dimensions expanded the theoretical and methodological
          scope of the Apparatus toward a multimodal understanding of embodied data. Sound variables
          made the temporal qualities of symptoms perceptible, while gestures revealed tacit bodily
          knowledge through movement and interaction. During the workshops, gestures emerged as
          expressive actions rather than mere techniques for construction, confirming the initial highlights
          emerged from the other workshops. Participants pressed, pushed, tore, and deformed materials
          to externalise discomfort, often associating the intensity of gesture with the perceived severity
          or recurrence of symptoms. Actions such as twisting, destroying, or compressing conveyed
          sensations of tension, pressure, and persistence, transforming bodily experience into visible and
          performative expression. Figure 7.16 highlights a selection of gestures participants performed as
          they manipulated the material to generate sound. In some cases, gestures were only imagined
          or narrated, yet they still revealed the participant’s impulse to act upon the material as part of
          the meaning-making process. By activating the materials through gesture, participants enacted
          relations between the physical and emotional dimensions of illness. Together, sound and gesture
          complemented the material and linguistic layers of the Apparatus, extending its potential for
          multisensory and process-based inquiry and demonstrating how embodied movement can
          operate as a form of interpretation and collective sense-making.</p>
        <p>In summary, the application of the Apparatus in this workshop confirmed its relevance beyond
          the specific context of UTIs. It proved effective as a participatory framework to elicit, articulate,
          and compare personal experiences of illness or discomfort, supporting dialogue through tangible
          and auditory expression. Some limitations also emerged during this process. Although sound
          variables were already part of the physical set, having them separated was useful to focus on
          sound production as the main topic of the workshop but occasionally created confusion due to
          overlaps and interrelations between certain variables. Participants’ familiarity with sound qualities
          and vocabulary was limited, and understanding how sound emerges through material interaction
          required more guidance than expected. While physical features could be perceived directly by
          touching materials, the abstract and temporal nature of sound made it more difficult to describe
          and interpret, even with an introductory explanation. Additionally, documentation also presented
          challenges, as gestures needed to be recorded in real time to capture how sound unfolded through
          movement. Despite these complexities, the workshop demonstrated the apparatus’s adaptability
          and its potential as a living methodological tool that evolves with each new use, supporting the
          production of shared understanding across diverse contexts.</p>

        <h4 class="chapter-7-title">Rethinking materials and gestures in the Apparatus</h4>
        <p>As confirmed by the Health Self-Revealed workshop, the specific components of the Data-Probe kit
          are not fundamental but rather they work as facilitators to prompt the use of variables. During the
          EKSIG session, participants worked with a less structured and more varied collection of materials
          than those used in the original workshops, yet the activity still succeeded in generating meaningful
          discussions and expressive results. This confirms that the effectiveness of the Apparatus depends
          not on the specific materials provided but on the way participants engage with their sensory
          and conceptual properties. Materials act as mediators that trigger exploration, comparison, and
          reflection, helping participants externalise sensations through texture, weight, or resistance. Their
          function is therefore to enable interaction rather than to define the method or the outcomes of the
          process.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, as shown by the analysis of earlier workshop sessions, gesture assumed a
          more explicit role than the one currently accounted for in the Apparatus, where it is not explicitly
          addressed. A specific set of gesture labels was integrated to investigate how movement
          contributes to the production of meaning. The EKSIG workshop confirmed the importance of
          this dimension, particularly when materials are explored and valued for the actions they can
          enact through physical engagement. Gestures expanded the expressive potential of materials,
          introducing a performative layer to the representation of sensations. In several cases, participants
          selected materials based on the gestures they imagined performing, such as rubbing, striking, or
          compressing, indicating that movement not only enriches the meaning of a material but can also
          determine its selection.</p>
        <p>These observations suggest that gestures may become a formal component of future
          iterations of the Apparatus. Recognising gestures as a distinct set within the system would allow
          their expressive and interpretative roles to be emerge more systematically, supporting further
          investigation into how bodily action and material response co-produce meaning. In this sense,
          the Apparatus continues to evolve within a methodological perspective that prioritises relational
          engagement over predefined form, shifting focus from artefact design to the conditions that make
          participation, interpretation, and collective understanding possible.</p>
