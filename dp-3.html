                My experience with urinary tract diseases began last February, <span class="recurrences">I had five urinary infections in a row</span>. For all the infections, I had the classic symptoms: <span class="urine">difficulty urinating, burning</span>, <span class="lower-abdomen">the sensation of not having emptied the bladder, kidney pain</span>. Since my general practitioner was far away, the infections were treated with prescribed antibiotics (given without knowing what type of infection it was), in order: FOSFOMYCIN, CIPROFLOXACIN, FOSFOMYCIN, FOSFOMYCIN. After the last cystitis, my doctor prescribed a urine test and a gynecological visit. The whole time, I took cranberry supplements and painkillers. The last infection was the most painful, it flared up very quickly, within an hour, causing sharp pains and not allowing me to get up from where I was. That evening, I had to take a train, and it was a very difficult journey. I arrived at the station supported by my boyfriend because I couldn't walk due to the pain. The following day, it got much worse, causing me <span class="fever">fever</span> and <span class="vomiting">vomiting</span>. I went to the gynecologist at the local clinic who, given the situation, after the visit and an ultrasound, prescribed me, in addition to the necessary antibiotic due to the severity of the infection, a 6-month treatment of ECN and 30 days of DEVAMIX (probiotics) + Saugella active for intimate washes. After the last cystitis, I haven't had any more severe ones, I continued the treatment for 6 months, and when I felt the first symptoms, I added cranberry supplements. The infections caused me various problems in sexual intercourse, which I interrupted for several months.

            <p class="oral-description">"No, so, there are 5 (artefact blocks) because, in reality, I have never suffered severely from urinary tract diseases. I have had very <span class=".treatments">mild cystitis, which I treated with supplements, always cranberry</span>, but it never turned into something that gave me serious and severe symptoms. Until February, when I had <span class="urine">consecutive episodes that I actually associate with a single episode</span>. For this reason, I composed different forms that were effectively <span class="urine">5 different episodes, but I see them as a single episode because I was never truly well throughout the entire illness</span>. So, it starts with the first phase, and as you see, in the first four phases, I had similar symptoms that only increased or decreased depending on the phase I was in. What changed is that, compared to the first time I had it, <span class="anxiety">I felt increasingly less stable</span>. In fact, further along, the more the sculptures fall because, <span class="anxiety">with the repetition of the illness, with the recurrence of symptoms, the most severe symptom in the end was the anxiety and fear I had towards the illness. That is represented by the wooden cube, which gets bigger and bigger. But it is bigger because anxiety increases, yet it becomes less and less stable</span>. Until the last stage, which was <span class="infection">the most severe, causing a very serious infection</span> with <span class="vomiting">vomiting</span>,  <span class="fever">fever</span>, and <span class="infection">the need for urgent intervention</span>. And, as you can see, it is completely unstable and is represented by more wooden cubes, more wood, and therefore <span class="anxiety">more anxiety on my part</span>. The last form is what remains because <span class="anxiety">I still have symptoms related to these episodes, mainly linked to fear and how these episodes have influenced my life, causing me anxiety, especially regarding sexual intercourse and everything that, for me, could trigger that illness</span>. And so, what remains are heavy metal balls. That's it."</p>
