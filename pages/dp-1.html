                  She has been a practicing nurse for six years and recently completed a master’s degree in nursing sciences. Her professional experience includes working in gynecology clinics, supporting both expectant mothers and young women, which has given her a strong foundation in topics related to women’s health. Currently, she works in a care home for the elderly, where she frequently manages cases of urinary tract infections (UTIs), encountering them almost daily. Although she has not personally experienced UTIs, she brings valuable professional insights and expertise from her clinical practice to the subject.
