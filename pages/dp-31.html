Neck pain, yeah. It's so obvious. Um, neck pain. <br /><i>[Another members of the group]</i> That's why it's bigger than yours. But actually <span class="neck-pain">we all used um, this polar, uh, material. Yeah. Triangles and no, uh, balls. So that's what we all have in common when we chose the objects [2]</span>. This was clear. Well, there is one little round shape hidden here that, um, ** picked. <br /><i>[Another member of the group]</i> Yeah, it's here <i>[the polyester sphere they refer to is hidden in this picture but visible from others as it is one the other side of the artefact]</i>. I put it here. Um, but then we're also saying, um, like this one also just kind of like <span class="shoulder-pain">I chose this because that is the ideal state of my shoulder when it's like soft, which is like a distant memory. And this is like, kind of connecting, like, it also feels like, you know, when you're like, you're feeling this kind of strain [3]</span>. Um, but yeah, also memory connector to what that state could be like, um, and yeah, heaviness. [...] I mean, <span class="shoulder-pain">the ball</span> had kind of, where is the ball? Yeah, I mean, it <span class="shoulder-pain">was kind of already, like, marred and, and kind of, um, damaged. So this is what I feel my shoulder is coming in stages, to be fair</span>.”
