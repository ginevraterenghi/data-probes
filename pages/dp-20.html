                  Almost 8 years ago I experienced UTI. <span class="lower-abdomen">I felt a lot of pain in my bladder and kidney. I could not walk up right. I had to bend my torso and be hunched in order to move around because my bladder and kidney was hurting</span>. I didn’t take any medication and I did not go to the doctor and <span class="treatments">it went away in a few days on its own</span>. I remember experiencing this pain for the first time, and asking my older sister and her friends who happened to be around at the time at my place. I shared my symptoms and they told me it was UTI. I wasn’t sure if they knew what I was from personal experience or if it was because they were majoring in anatomy and biology in university. After experiencing UTI, I was a bit more aware of what could potentially cause this and cared more for my hygiene and my partner’s hygiene during sex. I also now have the habit of peeing right after sex.
