        <p>This page presents the PhD thesis and provides access to all chapters of the research. The thesis
          investigates how embodied and subjective health experiences can be articulated, interpreted, and shared within
          healthcare contexts, with a particular focus on women’s experiences of urinary tract infections and
          antimicrobial consumption. Drawing on participatory design and data physicalization, the research examines how
          knowledge emerges through material engagement, interaction, interpretation, and collective sense making. For

        <h2 class="chapter-2-title">Abstract</h2>
        <p>This doctoral research investigats how data physicalization can support awareness and
          communication of symptoms in women affected by urinary tract infections (UTIs). Through a
          design approach, the study explores how personal and bodily experiences can become shared
          and collectively valued forms of knowledge. Drawing from feminist theories of situated knowledge
          and biosemiotics, symptoms are reconsidered as interpretative processes that acquire meaning
          through the continuous interaction between body, perception, and environment, rather than as fixed
          biomedical evidence. Within this frame, the research advances the concept of physical variables,
          which are material properties such as texture, weight, and shape, conceived as a participatory
          device for knowledge generation.</p>
          <p>UTIs are among the most common bacterial infections, disproportionately affecting women and
          often recurring over time. Communication around symptoms, however, remains limited because
          clinical practice privileges measurable biological indicators, while lived experience is often
          marginalised. In response to this gap, and drawing on autographic design, the research adopts a
          participatory approach in which material engagement enables embodied sensations to take shape.
          Through participatory data physicalization, making becomes a process of knowing, as participants
          work with tangible materials to express, reflect on, and communicate their bodily experiences. This
          process supports awareness of symptoms while creating shared forms through which experiences
          of disease can be articulated and discussed.</p>
         <p>Five workshops were conducted between 2023 and 2024 in Switzerland and the United
          Kingdom, involving around fifty participants. Three sessions, involving women affected by recurrent
          UTIs and clinicians, form the analytical core of the research. Participants used a set of modular
          components defined as Data-Probes, guided by symptom and physical-variable labels and a structured
          workshop protocol, to construct artefacts that represent their interpretation of symptoms.
          The findings show that engagement with physical variables enabled participants to articulate
          sensations and emotions often excluded from biomedical accounts. By translating experiences
          such as pressure, pain, or burning into tangible artefacts, participants were encouraged to reflect
          on and compare their experiences, recognise patterns, and share interpretations. Through this
          process, material engagement transformed individual sensations into collective insights by providing shared
          reference points that made experiences visible and comparable. This supported
          dialogue and awareness of embodied conditions, while also creating a common structure for
          interpreting and analysing symptoms collectively.</p>
          <p>In this direction, the main methodological contribution is the development of the Physical
          Variable Apparatus, a material-discursive arrangement that translates theoretical foundations into
          participatory practice by connecting labels, protocols, material components, and a digital interface
          into a system that supports participation, physical engagement, and interpretation.
          Beyond UTIs, the approach offers a transferable model for embodied data into participatory
          enquiry. Future work could extend the Apparatus to other chronic or subjective conditions and
          integrate digital or computational tools to connect embodied knowledge with medical data
          systems. The study contributes to design theory and practice by showing how data physicalization
          can act as a generative process for collective knowledge production, making embodied
          experience visible, interpretable, and meaningful across contexts.
        </p>

         <h2 class="chapter-2-title">Contribution to knowledge</h2>
        <p>Situated at the intersection of design research, data physicalization, and women's healthcare, in this
          thesis, I propose new ways of engaging with embodied experience as a valid and communicable
          form of knowledge. Through the development and application of the Physical-Variable Apparatus,
          the research advances methodological, theoretical, and empirical understanding of how material
          engagement can support participatory knowledge creation in healthcare contexts.</p>
          <p>Methodologically, I introduce the physical variables as a means to elicit, structure, and interpret
          embodied data. Applied through participatory data physicalization workshops, these variables
          guide the translation of perceptions into tangible and discussable forms, enabling participants
          to express and compare experiences collectively. The development of Data-Probes, as material
          components, formalises this process, turning acts of making and reflection into systematic
          methods for capturing and analysing embodied knowledge. Complementing this, a cross-format
          digital interface integrates results from material artefacts, narratives, and symptom–variable
          associations, supporting multimodal analysis and interpretation. Together, these contributions
          reposition data physicalization as a methodological approach for observing and analysing the
          processes through which knowledge emerges rather than representing predefined data.</p>
          <p>Theoretically, I support data physicalization as a generative and epistemic process. By
          introducing physical variables as instruments that actively shape knowledge production, I want
          to demonstrate how materiality participates in meaning-making rather than merely representing
          information. This perspective reframes data as interpretive and relational, co-constructed through
          the interaction between people, materials, and perception. The work thus extends the field toward
          a process-oriented understanding of how design can contribute to situated and participatory forms
          of knowing.</p>
          <p>Empirically, the thesis contributes to understanding women's experiences of urinary tract
          infections by articulating how participatory and material practices can enrich clinical perspectives.
          The findings reveal the importance of psycho-emotional and relational factors in symptom
          experience and communication. Through the use of material and reflective practices, participants
          generated new descriptors and metaphors that expanded the vocabulary of illness, making
          embodied experiences visible and comparable. These articulations fostered dialogue between
          patients and clinicians and among individuals with similar conditions, highlighting how participatory
          design can complement medical data with patient-led forms of understanding.</p>
          <p>Overall, the thesis establishes a design-led approach to healthcare knowledge that recognises
          embodied data as co-produced through participation. By integrating participatory design, material
          engagement, and interpretive analysis, it contributes to more inclusive and situated forms of
          communication and awareness around the body and illness experience.</p>

       <h2 class="chapter-1-title">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
       <p>In this doctoral research, I examine how design can contribute to the understanding and
          communication of embodied experiences in the healthcare scenario. Through a design method, I
          explore how material, participatory, and data informed approaches support the articulation of these
          experiences and enable forms of knowledge and dialogue within clinical contexts.
          This PhD research originated within SPEARHEAD (SwissPandemic AMR Health Economy
          Awareness Detect), a four-year project (2022–2025) funded by the Swiss Innovation Agency
          (Innosuisse). SPEARHEAD brings together a consortium of eight public and four private Swiss
          institutions with the aim of developing multidisciplinary responses to antimicrobial resistance
          (AMR). The project adopts a cross sectoral perspective that combines scientific, technological, and
          social expertise to promote responsible antibiotic use through prevention, stewardship, and public
          engagement (SPEARHEAD, n.d.).
          Within this consortium my role was as a collaborator at the Institute of Design (IDe) of the
          University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), where Dr Serena
          Cangiano led the Subproject 3, that seeks to involve citizens and raise public awareness of AMR.
        </p>
        <p>MAKEAWARE!, which is the name of the initiative developed for this purpose, employs design
          approaches to make complex health issues tangible and understandable, developing interactive
          and data-based activities that support reflection, dialogue, and participation (Cangiano et al.,
          2024). My contribution focused on the development of the engagement strategy and the design
          of participatory activities. This work provided the initial context for the doctoral research and
          introduced the interdisciplinary environment from which the research topic progressively evolved. It
          highlighted the crucial role patients play as holders of experiential knowledge about their condition,
          knowledge that is not always acknowledged or integrated into diagnostic practices. This gap
          underscored the importance of recognising how personal experience and clinical procedures
          intersect in everyday care. Guided by these insights, the research began to focus on urinary tract
          infections (UTIs) as an embodied experience, one that can be most accurately described and
          interpreted by those who live with the condition. This shift drew attention to the communicative
          challenges faced by patients and the ways in which interactions with healthcare providers influence
          treatment decisions. This process shaped the direction of the thesis, which is outlined in the
          following sections and visually summarised in Figure 1.1.</p>
          <br>

          <h2 class="chapter-1-title">1.1 Research problem</h2>
        <p>Difficulties in describing and interpreting symptoms form the starting point for this research,
          particularly when these descriptions are expected to contribute meaningfully to diagnosis. This
          challenge becomes especially evident in the context of urinary tract infections (UTIs), which
          account for a substantial proportion of antibiotic use. Their high frequency, tendency to recur, and
          frequent reliance on empirical prescribing mean that even small uncertainties in how symptoms
          are expressed or understood can influence patterns of antimicrobial consumption on a wider scale.
          For many women, UTI symptoms are intimate, changeable, and sometimes ambiguous, and
          their description is not always afforded sufficient trust during clinical encounters. When patients
          feel uncertain about how to express their experiences, or when their accounts are not recognised
          as meaningful forms of evidence, a communication gap emerges between patients and clinicians.
        </p>
        <p>This gap shapes treatment decisions and can limit opportunities for shared understanding and
          participation in care. In this wider landscape, improving the perception and communication of
          symptoms is essential for strengthening treatment pathways and reducing avoidable antibiotic use.
          Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a growing global health concern. Although resistance
          is a natural biological process, its progression is accelerated by extensive antibiotic use across
          healthcare, agriculture, and everyday life. Without meaningful change, resistant infections are
          projected to cause up to ten million deaths annually by 2050 (O’Neill, 2016).
          Enhancing how symptoms are understood, articulated, and trusted in clinical practice is therefore
          an important part of responding to AMR. Supporting clearer and more confident symptom
          communication can lead to more appropriate treatment decisions and contribute to broader efforts
          to limit unnecessary antibiotic consumption.</p>

           <p>
          Based on this issue, I formulated the following research questions to guide the theoretical and
          methodological trajectory of this thesis. They have been shaped and organised in a progressive
          logic. The first examines how participatory design enables women to contribute actively to the
          creation and interpretation of their data. The second explores how material engagement transforms
          personal experiences into tangible and communicable forms. The third introduces physical
          variables as the set of relations through which these expressions are organised, compared, and
          shared to support collective understanding. I present each research question with its specific
          objective and methodological orientation. Because the study adopts an exploratory approach, the
          rationale for each question is included to clarify the intentions that guide their development.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            RQ1. How can participatory design practices expand healthcare enquiry by enabling women to
            articulate embodied experience and contribute to the co-creation of knowledge?
          </span>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> The first question positions design within healthcare and investigates how
          participatory practices can create new forms of engagement between women affected by UTIs,
          clinicians, and researchers. The objective is to explore how women can take an active role in
          describing their symptoms and contribute to more contextual and meaningful data that can
          complement biomedical information.
          <br><strong>Approach:</strong> This question is addressed through a review of literature across design,
          feminist
          theory, and healthcare studies. In parallel, semi-structured interviews with medical experts working
          on antimicrobial resistance help to clarify the role of data within the patient scenario and to identify
          opportunities for improving awareness and communication, including the types of information that
          are most useful for diagnosis. The insights gained from this combined enquiry inform the design of
          the Shape Your Symptoms workshop format, where participants collectively explore and describe
          their experiences through co-creation and reflection.
          <br><strong>Rationale:</strong> Healthcare systems have traditionally privileged standardised knowledge, often
          marginalising lived and gendered experiences. Participatory design provides a way to redress
          these imbalances by involving women as co-investigators in the process of understanding illness.
          Through collaborative and reflective activities, design practices make it possible to surface
          embodied experiences that are difficult to communicate, thereby strengthening awareness,
          agency, and understanding.

          <span class="rq-heading">
            RQ2. How can material engagement support the interpretation
            and communication of intimate and embodied experiences within
            participatory data physicalization practices?
          </span>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> The second question focuses on the role of materiality in making bodily sensations
          perceptible and communicable. This question investigates how tactile and visual exploration
          enables participants to translate personal experiences into shared and interpretable forms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Approach:</strong> To address this question, the study introduces Data-Probes, which are material
          components with different textures, weights, and qualities. Through hands-on interaction with these
          components during participatory workshops, women affected by UTIs construct artefacts that
          embody their sensations. These artefacts are documented, analysed, and discussed to understand
          how material engagement supports reflection and communication.
          <br><strong>Rationale:</strong> Material engagement transforms symptom description into a reflective and
          collective
          process. Through direct interaction with materials, participants externalise personal sensations and
          develop new approaches to perceive and communicate their experiences. The process supports
          introspection and dialogue, allowing sensitive or stigmatised aspects of health to be discussed
          through external and tangible elements. In this way, materiality becomes an active agent in the
          creation of meaning and the sharing of embodied knowledge.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            RQ3. How can physical variables transform individual interpretations
            of embodied experience into collective knowledge?
          </span>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> The third question introduces physical variables as the main contribution through
          which embodied data are structured and interpreted. Variables are conceived to formalise how
          material properties such as texture, weight, and shape can support the transition from individual
          experiences into expressions that can be compared, discussed, and understood collectively.
          <br><strong>Approach:</strong> The research analyses the artefacts and narratives produced during the
          workshops
          to identify recurring links between symptoms and material properties. These links form the basis for
          defining physical variables as shared structure that connect individual experiences. This process
          leads to the development of the Physical-Variable Apparatus, which organises the relationship
          between participation, material engagement, and interpretation.
          <br><strong>Rationale:</strong> Physical variables provide a conceptual and methodological connection between
          personal experiences and shared understanding. Variables enable participants to reflect upon their
          expressions and align their subjective sensations at can be described in comparable ways while
          preserving their specificity. In this way, the variables position data physicalization not as a technique
          for representation but as a process through which knowledge is generated collaboratively.
          <br>In this thesis, collective knowledge refers to the shared understanding that emerges when women
          affected by UTIs express, interpret, and compare their embodied experiences through participatory
          and material practices. Through co-creation, discussion, and the use of material artefacts,
          individual sensations become articulated in ways that allow participants and clinicians to recognise
          patterns, differences, and relations across experiences. Figure 1.2 summarises the specific
          objectives, approaches and rationale for each of the research questions.
        </p>
        <br>

          <h2 class="chapter-1-title">1.3 Research aims</h2>
        <p>The aim of this doctoral research is to advance understanding of how embodied experiences of
          UTIs can be communicated and recognised within clinical consultations and broader diagnostic
          processes. The study responds to the persistent gap between women’s lived experiences and
          the standard forms of information that guide diagnosis and treatment. This gap reflects broader
          limitations in how healthcare systems and clinical practices engage with subjective, intimate, and
          context-dependent forms of knowledge.
          In this direction, my intention is to develop and study design-based approaches that support
          women in expressing embodied sensations in ways that are perceptible, interpretable, and
          meaningful for clinical decision making and patient–clinician communication. By doing so, the
          study contributes to more responsive and inclusive forms of symptom communication.
        </p>
        <p>More specifically, the research aims to bring lived experience into closer dialogue with clinical knowledge;
          support women in developing awareness of their bodily sensations and expressing them
          through participatory and material practices; explore how material engagement can help transform subjective
          sensations into communicable
          expressions; improve communication between patients and healthcare providers by introducing expressions
          of symptoms that complement biomedical accounts; strengthen data physicalization as an approach for generating
          knowledge that connects
          individual experiences with shared understanding in healthcare contexts.
          These aims establish the conceptual purpose of the research and frame the methodological
          direction that follows.</p>
          <br>

          <h2 class="chapter-1-title">1.4 Research objectives</h2>
        <p>To pursue these aims, I structured the research around the following objectives. Each objective
          describes a concrete step that enables the study to meet its broader purpose. The objectives identified are
          the following:
          <br>1) Develop participatory practices for expressing embodied experience: Design and conduct
          workshops that enable women affected by UTIs to articulate symptoms, exchange experiences,
          and reflect on the meanings they assign to bodily sensations.
          <br>2) Investigate material engagement as a means of interpretation: Introduce material
          components that support participants in externalising embodied sensations and translating them
          into tangible and communicable forms.
          <br>3) Establish physical variables as structures for shared understanding: Analyse the artefacts
          and narratives produced during the workshops to identify material properties such as texture,
          shape, weight or density that can organise individual expressions into patterns that aid comparison
          and interpretation.
          <br>4) Produce a methodological contribution for healthcare communication: Synthesise insights
          from participatory and material practices to form a coherent method that can support patient
          agency, enrich contextual knowledge, and engage clinicians with embodied experience through
          a design methodology. These objectives translate the aims into specific actions that shape the
          design and execution of the research.</p>
           <br>

          <h2 class="chapter-1-title">1.5 Outputs and outcomes</h2>
       <p>Drawing on the research questions and the methods applied, I produced a set of outputs and
          outcomes that together constitute the contribution of the work. Outputs refer to the practical
          and tangible elements generated during the enquiry. Outcomes refer to the conceptual and
          methodological advances that arise from the analysis of these outputs.

          <br>

          <h2 class="chapter-1-title">1.6 The structure of this thesis</h2>
        <p>I structured the thesis into eight chapters to reflect the progression of the enquiry from context
          to theory, methodology, analysis, and contribution. Following this introduction in Chapter 1, each subsequent
          chapter develops the theoretical,
          methodological, and empirical dimensions of the research in a progressive sequence.
          Chapter 2 introduces UTIs as both a clinical condition and a gendered health concern. The
          chapter examines how women are disproportionately affected and how systemic biases in
          medical research have limited the recognition of women’s embodied experiences. Drawing on
          feminist theories, biosemiotics, and autographic design, the chapter positions symptoms as
          interpretative and material phenomena that acquire meaning through perception and interaction.
          These perspectives establish the conceptual grounding for a participatory design approach that
          recognises the body as both source and interpreter of its own evidence.
          Chapter 3 describes the methodological approach developed to investigate how material
          engagement supports the communication of embodied experiences. Building on the theoretical
          foundations of the previous chapter, it introduces physical variables as mediators between
          perception and interpretation and presents Data-Probes as participatory artefacts that enable
          people to externalise sensations. The Shape Your Symptoms workshop protocol is detailed as the
          practical application of this approach, combining reflection, co-creation, and discussion to foster
          awareness and patient agency in healthcare.
          Chapter 4 reports on the empirical work that I conducted through five participatory workshops in
          Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Three core sessions involving women with lived experience
          of UTIs form the basis of the analysis. I examine multimodal data (artefacts, transcripts, and
          written reflections) using thematic and compositional interpretation to identify how participants
          expressed and compared their symptoms and experiences through material engagement. I
          present the findings along two directions: the experiential insights produced about UTIs and the
          methodological observations regarding the use of materiality for symptom interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>Chapter 5 presents the validation phase conducted with medical experts. Healthcare
          professionals reviewed workshop outcomes to assess the clarity and clinical relevance of
          participants’ expressions. Their feedback confirmed the value of the insights generated and
          highlighted the potential of participatory and material methods to complement medical
          understanding and foster patient-centred communication.
          Chapter 6 discusses the findings, focusing on how physical variables support the
          perception and communication of symptoms within participatory data physicalization. The
          chapter examines how material engagement bridges the gap between biomedical data and lived
          experience, showing how participants developed shared vocabularies for describing complex
          sensations. The discussion concludes that physical variables act as generative elements of
          interpretation and knowledge creation.
          Chapter 7 consolidates the Physical-Variable Apparatus as the central methodological outcome
          of the research. Physical variables operate as a system for knowledge generation, integrating
          participation, material engagement, and interpretation into a single process. The chapter describes
          the Apparatus and its four components, which are the labels, the workshop protocol, the
          Data-Probes, and cross-format analysis interface. Taken together, the apparatus’ components
          enable embodied experiences to be interpreted and collectively expressed so to generate shared
          knowledge.
          Chapter 8 concludes the thesis by synthesising the overall research process and outcomes.
          The chapter revisits how the study addressed the communication of symptoms in women affected
          by UTIs and how participatory data physicalization provided an alternative to biomedical models by
          valuing embodied knowledge. The main contributions are summarised, together with reflections on
          limitations, and directions for future work, including applications of the approach in other health and
          social contexts.
          <br>The thesis concludes with the Bibliography and Appendix, which include ethics approval
          documents, workshop conversation and interview transcripts to ensure the transparency of this work. </p>

       <h2 class="chapter-2-title">2. LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND TO CO-CREATE KNOWLEDGE FROM SYMPTOMS</h2>
       <p>In this chapter, I introduce urinary tract infections (UTIs), addressing this disease as both a clinical
          issue and a gendered health concern. UTIs are among the most common bacterial infections,
          causing significant personal discomfort and contributing to the global problem of antimicrobial
          resistance (AMR). Diagnosis often relies on patients’ descriptions of their symptoms, which, while
          essential, are inherently subjective. Misinterpretation of these accounts can lead to misdiagnosis,
          recurrent infections, and unnecessary antibiotic use. Even more specifically, the human
          consumption of antibiotics is the main driver of resistance development and, for this reason, limiting
          antibiotic use has been highlighted as a prime policy concern in efforts to address antimicrobial
          resistance (Adda, 2020). Although UTIs can affect individuals of all genders, women experience
          them disproportionately due to anatomical, hormonal, and behavioural factors. This disparity
          extends beyond biology, revealing how gender influences susceptibility, symptom communication,
          and treatment within a healthcare system that has historically underrepresented women in
          research and undervalued their experiences (Almeida et al., 2016; Perez, 2019). Addressing UTIs,
          therefore, requires confronting not only biological factors but also structural biases that shape how
          symptoms are perceived, recorded, and acted upon.
          The subjective and embodied nature of symptoms demands methods that move beyond
          detached observation and externally imposed data collection. Conventional biomedical practices
          often extract patient accounts as impersonal data to be recognised through a process of
          standardisation by professionals, stripping them of context and diminishing their relevance to those
          experiencing illness. In contrast, this research adopts the concept of situated knowledge (Haraway,
          1988), emphasising that meaningful representations of health must be co-created with those who
          live with the condition.
        </p>
        <p>Within this context, symptoms are framed as material traces that acquire meaning through
          interpretation. Symptoms are understood as manifestations of internal states that become
          significant through bodily perception and interaction. This framing builds on two key perspectives:
          biosemiotics considers symptoms as bodily signs within an ongoing process of signalling and
          meaning-making, while autographic design extends this view by treating these signs as self-inscribing
          qualities that can be revealed and interpreted through material engagement and
          data physicalization. Together, these perspectives recognise the body as both the source and
          interpreter of its own evidence.
          To enable this interpretation to emerge and to support understanding between individuals with
          lived experience of UTIs and medical professionals, participation becomes a means of connecting
          scientific knowledge with everyday realities. Through participatory engagement, mutual learning
          is fostered and insights are produced that no single actor could generate alone (van Wart et al.,
          2020). Participation is not framed as an additional step but as an integral practice through which
          participants actively shape how phenomena are explored, understood, and communicated.
          Grounded in design practices, participatory processes support people in collecting, interpreting,
          and communicating their own data, transforming situated personal interpretations into knowledge
          that holds value at a collective level.
          In this chapter, I present the theoretical background that supports the study and outline the
          literature on which it is based. The literature review and the theoretical background are introduced
          as a single, integrated process rather than as separate stages. Insights from design, healthcare,
          feminist theory, and data practices, organised and shown in Figure 2.1, come together to guide the
          methodological direction developed in Chapter 3.</p>
          <br>

           <h2 class="chapter-2-title">2.1 The problem of UTIs within women’s health</h2>
      <p>UTIs are faced within this work as both a clinical challenge and a gendered concern. UTIs are
          among the most widespread bacterial infections, causing significant personal suffering and
          contributing to the growing problem of antibiotic consumption and resistance. Diagnosis often
          relies on patients’ accounts of their symptoms, which, while essential, are inherently subjective.
          Misinterpretation of these accounts can lead to misdiagnosis, recurrence, and unnecessary
          antibiotic use. As women are disproportionately affected, and their experiences are often
          undervalued due to structural gender bias in medical data and practice, feminist perspectives are
          introduced to challenge these exclusions, recognising women’s embodied knowledge as crucial for
          advancing more equitable and effective care.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            2.1.1 UTI disease concerns
          </span>
          UTIs are among the most frequent bacterial infections worldwide, with an estimated 150 million
          cases each year (Mohiuddin, 2019). They represent a major public health concern due to their
          high incidence, impact on quality of life, and significant contribution to antibiotic consumption.
          Accurate diagnosis of UTIs is essential to ensure effective treatment and to avoid unnecessary use
          of antibiotics. However, diagnosis often depends heavily on how patients describe their symptoms
          during medical consultations. This reliance on patient narratives presents significant challenges.
          Symptoms such as pain, burning, urgency, or discomfort are personal experiences. They are
          variably expressed, influenced by personal perception, cultural factors, and communication
          styles, and they are sometimes incomplete or inconsistent (Masajtis-Zagajewska & Nowicki, 2017).
          However, they are fundamental in guiding critical treatment decisions, often before laboratory
          confirmation is available.
          The tension between objective signs and subjective symptoms defines the central difficulty
          of UTI diagnosis. Objective indicators, such as urine culture results or the presence of fever, are
          prioritized in medical practice because they are measurable and verifiable. However, these results are not
          always accessible when decisions need to be made. Laboratory
          tests require time, and in many primary care settings, they are unavailable at the moment of
          consultation (Ribers and Ullrich, 2022). As a result, physicians must often make decisions based on
          incomplete information, relying on the patient’s description of their condition.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            Women’s involvement and causes of infection
          </span>
          Women experience UTIs far more frequently than men, with about 81% of all UTIs reported
          in women (Kaur and Kaur, 2020). An estimated 40 to 50 percent of women will have at least one
          episode during their lifetime, compared with around 5 percent of men (Mohiuddin, 2019). This
          disparity stems primarily from anatomical and physiological differences. The female urethra is
          shorter, meaning bacteria have less distance to travel before reaching the bladder and less time
          to be removed by urination. The urethral opening is also positioned closer to the anus, allowing
          easier transfer of uropathogenic bacteria from the perineal area to the bladder. Additionally, the
          vaginal and periurethral environments are more susceptible to microbial colonization, particularly
          during periods of hormonal change (Pigrau and Escolà-Vergé, 2020). The presence of the vaginal
          cavity and the close proximity of the rectum to the urethral opening create favorable conditions
          for bacterial colonization. Beyond these anatomical factors, several other risk factors contribute to
          recurring UTIs in women, including behavioral factors, genetic susceptibility, age-specific factors,
          pregnancy-related factors, and urinary catheterization.
          Several biological and behavioural conditions further increase susceptibility. Menopause
          reduces levels of estrogen, which can alter the vaginal flora and diminish natural protection against
          pathogens. Diabetes compromises immune function and increases glucose in urine, providing a
          favourable environment for bacterial growth. Behavioural factors include frequent sexual activity,
          sexual initiation at an early age, recent changes in sexual partners, and the use of spermicides, all
          of which disrupt normal flora and facilitate bacterial colonisation. Previous antibiotic use is also a
          contributing factor, as it can disturb the protective balance of lactobacilli in the vaginal microbiota,
          leaving women more vulnerable to infection (Pigrau and Escolà-Vergé, 2020).
          Across these cases, the primary pathogen responsible for UTIs is Escherichia coli, which causes
          more than 80 percent of infections. Other microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
          Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, are also
          involved, particularly in recurrent or complicated cases (McLellan and Hunstad, 2016). The clinical
          presentation of UTIs depends on the site of infection. Lower urinary tract infections, commonly
          referred to as cystitis, typically cause symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and discomfort.
          Upper urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, present more severe manifestations such
          as fever, chills, nausea, and flank pain, reflecting a more systemic inflammatory response (Masajtis-
          Zagajewska and Nowicki, 2017).
          Because laboratory confirmation requires time and is often unavailable at the point of care,
          treatment is frequently initiated during the first consultation based on reported symptoms and
          patient history (Ribers and Ullrich, 2022). This reliance creates a diagnostic risk, as when symptoms
          are vague, unclear, or misinterpreted, the treatment may not target the actual cause of infection.
          A patient may receive an antibiotic that is ineffective against the bacteria responsible, which can
          reduce the likelihood of full recovery and prolong illness (Masajtis-Zagajewska and Nowicki, 2017).
          To minimize this risk under uncertainty, clinicians frequently prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics
          designed to treat a wide range of bacteria (OECD, 2019). While this strategy can offer immediate
          relief, it has unintended consequences, as broad-spectrum drugs disrupt the balance of normal
          bacteria in the body, potentially causing side effects and leaving behind resistant strains that are
          harder to treat (Holmes, 2016).
          <span class="rq-heading">
            Recurrence and chronic burden
          </span>
          Inadequate or inappropriate therapy may temporarily relieve symptoms without fully eradicating
          the infection, increasing the likelihood of recurrence. Between 20 and 30 percent of women
          experience a recurrent infection following an initial episode (McLellan and Hunstad, 2016).
          Recurrent UTIs are defined as two or more episodes within six months or three or more within
          twelve months. This leads to considering the impact extending beyond physical symptoms, as
          repeated pain, discomfort, and disruption to daily life, often lead to anxiety, frustration, and feelings
          of helplessness. Persistent infections can interfere with work, education, intimate relationships, and
          social participation (McLellan and Hunstad, 2016). Chronic cases are frequently associated with
          sleep disturbances, fatigue, and emotional distress, amplifying their personal and social burden.
          From a healthcare perspective, recurrent UTIs present ongoing challenges. They necessitate
          repeated consultations, diagnostic tests, and antibiotic prescriptions, increasing costs and
          resource demands (OECD, 2019).
          Prophylactic or long-term antibiotic regimens are sometimes used to prevent recurrence, but
          these strategies remain controversial. Although they may reduce short-term episode frequency,
          they contribute to resistance development by selecting resistant strains that perpetuate the cycle of
          infection (Holmes, 2016; Pigrau and Escolà-Vergé, 2020).
          <span class="rq-heading">
            Resistance development
          </span>
          What happens in all these cases is that unnecessary or inappropriate courses of antibiotics
          increase bacterial ability to withstand future treatments, making the disease progressively harder to
          manage. Resistant infections often demand more costly or invasive medications, longer treatment
          durations, and, in severe cases, hospitalisation (ECDC and WHO, 2022). For these reasons,
          antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is recognised as one of the most urgent global health threats. In
          2019, AMR directly caused an estimated 1.27 million deaths and contributed to nearly 5 million
          worldwide (Murray et al., 2022). Without effective action, projections indicate that AMR could result
          in 10 million deaths annually by 2050, surpassing cancer as the leading cause of mortality (O’Neill,
          2016).
          The intersection of AMR, UTIs, and antibiotic consumption becomes particularly visible when
          examining their combined contribution to health loss. Figure 2.2 highlights this by showing the share
          of deaths directly attributed to AMR related UTIs alongside the overall impact of UTIs and of AMR in
          2019.
          The severity of the situation also needs to take into account that the burden of recurrent UTIs
          extends beyond individual suffering to substantial societal consequences. The communication gap
          in UTI diagnosis is not a minor clinical issue but a critical link between personal illness and a global
          health crisis. Diagnostic uncertainty and reliance on symptom-based treatment sustain empirical
          antibiotic use, driving the spread of resistant pathogens. Breaking this cycle requires improved
          ways of capturing, interpreting, and integrating patient-reported symptoms into clinical
          decision-making. This research addresses this challenge by examining how subjective
          experiences of UTIs can be more effectively represented and communicated. Focusing on the
          lack of awareness and communication between patients and clinicians, the thesis is interested in
          investigating how individual narratives influence diagnostic accuracy, treatment outcomes, and the
          broader dynamics of healthcare.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            2.1.2 Feminist perspectives on UTIs as a gender issue
          </span>
          UTIs affect people of all genders but disproportionately impact women, a pattern linked to
          anatomical, hormonal, and behavioural factors that increase both susceptibility and recurrence.
          However, the significance of this disparity extends beyond biology. Gender also shapes how
          symptoms are perceived, articulated, and evaluated within clinical practice. Women have been
          historically underrepresented in medical research, and their embodied accounts are often
          undervalued or dismissed (Almeida et al., 2020a; Perez, 2019). This contributes to a clinical culture
          in which women’s expressions of pain, reported more readily and with greater sensitivity than
          men’s, are frequently misinterpreted as emotional excess or exaggeration rather than recognised
          as valid indicators of illness (Bever, 2022). These biases are further perpetuated by female health
          technologies often embody normative assumptions about women’s bodies and reproduce
          structural inequalities through their design (Billuart, 2024).
          Taken together, these perspectives show that UTIs are not only a biomedical condition but also
          a gendered issue shaped by entrenched sociocultural patterns that influence how symptoms are
          understood, recorded, and acted upon across healthcare systems.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            Gender bias in data and practice
          </span>
          Systemic gender bias permeates the production, interpretation, and application of medical data.
          Women have been historically excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials and large-scale
          datasets, resulting in treatments, technologies, and guidelines that are optimised for male
          physiology (Almeida et al., 2020a; Perez, 2019). This underrepresentation persists despite
          increasing evidence of sex-specific differences in disease presentation, drug metabolism, and
          treatment response, limiting the ability of healthcare systems to deliver effective and equitable care to
          women.
          Bias is not confined to data gaps but extends to the processes of data collection and use
          (D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). Women are frequently positioned as passive subjects in medical
          research rather than as active contributors to knowledge production (Thompson, 2020). This
          reinforces an asymmetry between those who control data and those whose bodies generate it
          (Fotopoulou, 2021). Such asymmetries have tangible effects on care, as demonstrated by the fact
          that women are prescribed less pain medication than men following equivalent procedures, are
          less likely to receive appropriate diagnostic testing, and are more often dismissed or under-treated
          when they report symptoms (Tomasello and Almeida, 2020).
          The problem is not unique to UTIs, but similar patterns exist across a range of conditions.
          Women suffering from chronic pain are more likely to have their symptoms attributed to
          psychological causes rather than to physiological conditions. Evidence also indicates that women’s
          reported experiences of pain are often perceived as exaggerated, despite studies suggesting
          that women may have greater pain sensitivity and a higher propensity to report pain accurately
          (Samulowitz et al., 2018; Bever, 2022). These disparities reflect entrenched cultural and institutional
          patterns that undermine the credibility of women’s embodied experiences.
          <span class="rq-heading">
            Situated knowledge and feminist critique
          </span>
          Feminist theory challenges these exclusions by highlighting the value of situated knowledge.
          Haraway (1988) argues that all knowledge is produced from specific, embodied standpoints,
          rather than from a universal, objective perspective. Within this framework, women’s experiences of
          UTIs are not peripheral to medical understanding but constitute essential evidence for improving
          diagnosis, treatment, and care. Recognising this knowledge challenges the hierarchy that places
          the need of quantifiable laboratory results above understanding personal experience.
          Historical feminist health movements laid the foundation for this critique. The Boston Women’s
          Health Book Collective’s 1971 publication Women and Their Bodies (later Our Bodies, Ourselves)
          exposed the paternalism of mainstream medicine, highlighting how opacity, authority, and
          mystification kept patients subordinate to medical professionals. By encouraging women to share
          personal experiences and reclaim knowledge about their own bodies, the collective drove a shift
          toward transparency, autonomy, and accountability in healthcare (Boston Women’s Health Book
          Collective, 1971).
          Contemporary feminist scholarship builds on these foundations by advocating for participatory
          and women-centred approaches that integrate embodied experience into research, design, and
          healthcare practices (Almeida et al., 2020; D’Ignazio and Klein, 2020). In design research, this shift
          has produced methods and tools that position women not as passive recipients but as co-creators
          of knowledge. The introduction of the Research and Feminism(s) track at the 2018 Design Research
          Society conference illustrates the growing recognition of feminist approaches as critical to
          rethinking how design engages with complex social issues, including health. In Human-Computer Interaction
          (HCI), there has been an expansion of research beyond maternal
          care to include topics such as menstruation, menopause, endometriosis, and chronic pelvic pain.
          These developments demonstrate a broader commitment to challenging exclusionary practices
          and to legitimising women’s embodied knowledge as a foundation for innovation.

            2.1.3 Positioning this research
          </span>
          Considering that UTIs primarily affect individuals with female anatomy due to structural and
          physiological factors such as shorter urethral length, hormonal fluctuations, and microbial
          interactions within the vaginal and urinary environments (Mohiuddin, 2019; Pigrau & Escolà-Vergé,
          2020), gender becomes a critical lens through which to examine both the medical and social
          dimensions of this condition.
          While this research focuses on women’s experiences, this choice does not imply that men’s
          experiences of UTIs or related conditions are less significant. Rather, attending to gendered
          differences makes visible the need for integrated approaches that address a broader spectrum of
          experiences. Insights generated from women’s experiences can inform more inclusive strategies,
          provided that future work continues to account for the diversity of bodies, identities, and health
          trajectories. This perspective emphasises the importance of approaches grounded in difference,
          treating it as a valuable source of knowledge rather than as a deviation from a norm.
          For this reason, it is important to clarify that within this thesis the term “women” is used in
          alignment with epidemiological and biomedical literature, in which women are identified as the
          group most affected by UTIs. At the same time, this work recognises the limitations of binary
          gender categories and acknowledges that not all individuals with female anatomy identify
          as women, and that not all women have female anatomy. The term is therefore employed
          pragmatically to maintain consistency with clinical research, while explicitly respecting gender
          diversity.
          On this basis, positioning the study within feminist theory constitutes both a methodological
          and an ethical choice. Feminist scholarship foregrounds situated and embodied perspectives,
          and challenges approaches that privilege detached notions of objectivity over lived experience
          (Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1991). In the context of UTIs, such perspectives are particularly relevant,
          as diagnosis relies heavily on symptom narratives. When these narratives are marginalised,
          the consequences may include misdiagnosis, ineffective treatment, and recurrent infections,
          reinforcing existing inequities in women’s health. To respond to these challenges, the following
          chapter introduces methods that recognise and strengthen women’s perspectives within
          diagnostic and care processes, proposing design based approaches to symptoms as a way to
          support and enhance the value of these lived experiences.
