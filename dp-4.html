				"I have already admitted that I do not know if I am talking about cystitis or candida. I still have not figured it out. The fact is that I treat it with antibiotics. The symptoms are the ones on the table. I have never had pain and nausea. <span class="nausea">Maybe nausea a few times</span>, but I do not know if it was due to that or to the fact that I was taking antibiotics. That said, for me too, <span class="recurrences">it is kind of an inter-temporal process, but not exactly</span>. <span class="urine">The starting point is incontinence</span>. I already have it on my own. You know I am always there, every time, in the bathroom. But it is <span class="urine">a different incontinence because it causes me pain [1]</span>. The reason for putting foam inside is actually because it is a material that absorbs. It seems to me like a material that holds liquids more than the others on the table. It absorbs and absorbs, but at the same time, it has this sort of chain around it that I simulated with string. This chain tries to contain it and creates these bubbles that become painful. <span class="urine">When the pee that remains, excuse my literary term, is still there, all inside, contained within the soft material that is my genital tract, it comes out and hurts [2]. It becomes sharp, and urinating becomes uncomfortable</span>. The little balls I placed, which we had actually associated with timing, I associated with a sensation that really bothers me. This sensation is linked to what came up during the workshop on leaks. <span class="leaks">These leaks [3] are also socially debilitating for me because they generate a bad odor. I can smell my bad odor</span> when I have candida. <span class="leaks">I perceive myself as having a different smell, and I think those around me perceive it too</span>. So it is not just physical pain but also something that debilitates me socially in my relationships with others. The rubber bands also fit well conceptually. They are not just for the odor. I used them for that because I thought, this stinks, hold it. But also because they close me off and cage me socially. It goes back to my initial symptom description. For me, it is very much about shutting myself off from others. When <span class="recurrences">I am in that state, exposed, and lately, every month or month and a half</span>, I have actually stopped taking antibiotics and switched to probiotics. These were recommended to me and are actually calming the situation a bit. This one, not yet, because it is still the symptom I always have. But I am managing to prevent it from reaching that stage where I am in pain, feel like I smell bad, or have such strong leaks that they make my workday difficult because I constantly feel dirty. But I have learned. I am experimenting with these new treatments that help me. These new treatments help me stay in the first stage, which is still constant because the infection is still ongoing at the moment. But it is an infection that I can manage. Similar to [another participant], I do so through a particular diet. For example, I recently eliminated gluten, and the intensity with which this infection manifests has decreased. And then, of course, hygiene. That is always there, but when you have this kind of problem, you try to be even more attentive.</p>
