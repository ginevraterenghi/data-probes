                I would like to share <span class="recurrences">one of my experiences</span>. I was only 22 years old. <span class="causes">The first time I had sex with my boyfriend</span> it was also his first sexual relationship. I don't know how sex education works in other countries. But in ** in the past, we didn't have much knowledge about it, we didn't talk about it in school, and our parents didn't tell us anything. Before we had sex, we only knew about buying condoms and showering. But when we opened the condom, we all felt that it smelled bad. So we didn't use condoms. <span class="causes">I remember being so shy, I was too embarrassed to even go to the toilet to pee. After the sex, I remember holding my pee all night</span>. After a day, <span class="urine">I felt a burning sensation when I urinated</span>, I thought I had a cold, <span class="treatments">I drank a lot of water, but it didn't help</span>. <span class="urine">The next day I saw blood in my urine</span> and by then <span class="pain">I was already feeling more pain</span>. I didn't know what was wrong with me and I was too embarrassed to ask my mother, so I asked a sister who was seven years older than me. But she had no such experience as well, so <span class="treatments">we went to the pharmacy to buy medicine together. I've forgotten which medicines. I remember I bought three</span>. I was afraid to go to the hospital, <span class="treatments">I wanted to buy several ones to try which one would be useful. Fortunately, after 3-4 days of taking the medication, my symptoms subsided. Then the symptoms slowly disappeared</span>. I hope it won't happen again. Now I take good care of my body and keep it clean and urinate on time.

             “I want to share the only one experience before when I had the UTI problem. But at that time I was just 22 years old and I was at university. <span class="treatments">I didn't go to see the doctors. I just searched some information on website and tried to buy some medicines from pharmacy. I bought around two to three kind of medicines and tried different one during two or three days, but I'm very I was very lucky. After that the the symptom is disappeared</span>. <span class="complexity">So my model is look like the symptom is inside your body. So you can feel it. It's it's like a when I go to university no one know I have this problem but I know it and I suffer from it</span>. If you have the good or right treatment you'll have a good body. But if you didn't take the right medicine maybe you will have the long time problem and you will got seek. So that's why I'm going to become like this. And I also want to mention the education for girls. If the girl can't know enough knowledge from the schools, and if their parents didn't tell them enough knowledge is very normal for girl to feel very scared and stressful when they face this problem. If they search the information online if they search the right information is fine. If they didn't search, search the good information, they will most scared about it and they will feel, oh, I'm nearly to die. Why? Why I have this problem and If you have a older sister or some or some sister-in-law, maybe you can ask advice. But if you only tell and <span class="anxiety">if you have nothing [no one] you can ask, it will become more stressful</span>. I think these are my feelings.”
