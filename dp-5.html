              <span class="recurrences">I suffered from cystitis for a fairly prolonged period</span> and once had a urinary tract infection. 
<span class="causes">It was probably due to a very difficult time in my life, to which my body reacted in this way.</span> 
Associated with this were <span class="causes">bad habits such as an inadequate diet and insufficient hydration</span>. 
Additionally, <span class="recurrences">if the illness is neglected, it tends to come back frequently</span>, which is what happened. 
The main symptoms were <span class="cramps">burning, cramps in the lower abdomen</span>, 
<span class="urine">difficulty urinating but at the same time feeling the urgent need to go</span>. 
Sometimes there were <span class="urine">traces of blood in my urine</span> (sorry). 
It was very <span class="urine">painful and debilitating</span>. 
I consulted my general practitioner, who initially advised me to 
<span class="alternatives">drink plenty of water and take a cranberry-based supplement</span>. 
The situation seemed to improve slightly, but <span class="recurrences">soon after, the symptoms returned</span>. 
As a result, I was prescribed antibiotics, which improved the condition. 
<span class="recurrences">The episode happened again several times, and I always treated it immediately with antibiotics because they had an immediate effect</span>. 
<span class="causes">The urinary tract infection was diagnosed in the emergency room as a probable consequence of neglected cystitis</span>. 
<span class="doctor">I remember that time the doctor did not respond for days, and I had no way to address the situation differently</span>.

				 “I do not know if I can explain it well. It is kind of a little monster. I also made it <span class="recurrences">with thread because, for me too, I immediately thought of something temporal, as if it were a process</span>. In my experience, a lot of time has passed, so <span class="anxiety">I feel a bit of tension</span>, but I think for everyone, the more time passes [since recovering], the smaller it seems [the disease]. However, in reality, I was very unwell. I suffered quite a bit from cystitis and also had an infection. <span class="cramps">The strongest memories I have</span>, which we also looked at today, <span class="cramps">were initially the cramps</span> combined with <span class="urine">burning</span>. I placed <span class="urine">two identical balls because, for me, those two discomforts were almost interchangeable</span>. They could be swapped in the timeline. <span class="discomfort">The roughness [sandpaper] represents the discomfort because it makes you feel uneasy, even with something as simple as going out</span>. You already have symptoms, you need to go to the bathroom, and maybe there are people around. For me, discomfort is tied to daily life. As time goes on, <span class="urine">I reach the moment when I feel uncertain. I do not know whether I need to go to the bathroom or not</span>. I remember the moment when I could not leave the house. So, I decided to create a <span class="urine">cube, and I added a texture with pins. For me, it is a combination of things. As we said earlier, the permeability of the material conveys a perception that is not actually physical</span>. The texture filters little liquid, and <span class="urine">the pins represent the persistent burning sensation</span>. Then, <span class="doctor">this big, messy knot for me is like a fork in the road. Here, I notify the doctor, and something happens</span>. What had happened to me was that <span class="recurrences">I already had a history of neglect and a lack of awareness</span> that it was cystitis, so I may have informed her too late. However, when I needed her, she did not answer. At this point, there is a <span class="infection">weight, a burden, which I associate with something heavier that turns into an infection. That was when it became truly debilitating because I had to go to the emergency room as I did not know what else to do</span>. Then, here, for me, there is <span class="alternatives">emptiness because I take an antibiotic, and the symptoms disappear</span>. But from this point on, when I travel, because it has happened to me while traveling, <span class="recurrences">it becomes a circular thing. It closes and returns</span>. I do not like that I always carry it with me.”
