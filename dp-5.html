              “I do not know if I can explain it well. It is kind of a little monster. I also made it <span class="recurrences">with thread because, for me too, I immediately thought of something temporal, as if it were a process</span>. In my experience, a lot of time has passed, so <span class="anxiety">I feel a bit of tension</span>, but I think for everyone, the more time passes [since recovering], the smaller it seems [the disease]. However, in reality, I was very unwell. I suffered quite a bit from cystitis and also had an infection. <span class="cramps">The strongest memories I have</span>, which we also looked at today, <span class="cramps">were initially the cramps</span> combined with <span class="urine">burning</span>. I placed <span class="urine">two identical balls because, for me, those two discomforts were almost interchangeable</span>. They could be swapped in the timeline. <span class="discomfort">The roughness [sandpaper] represents the discomfort because it makes you feel uneasy, even with something as simple as going out</span>. You already have symptoms, you need to go to the bathroom, and maybe there are people around. For me, discomfort is tied to daily life. As time goes on, <span class="urine">I reach the moment when I feel uncertain. I do not know whether I need to go to the bathroom or not</span>. I remember the moment when I could not leave the house. So, I decided to create a <span class="urine">cube, and I added a texture with pins. For me, it is a combination of things. As we said earlier, the permeability of the material conveys a perception that is not actually physical</span>. The texture filters little liquid, and <span class="urine">the pins represent the persistent burning sensation</span>. Then, <span class="vomiting">this big, messy knot for me is like a fork in the road. Here, I notify the doctor, and something happens</span>. What had happened to me was that <span class="recurrences">I already had a history of neglect and a lack of awareness</span> that it was cystitis, so I may have informed her too late. However, when I needed her, she did not answer. At this point, there is a <span class="infection">weight, a burden, which I associate with something heavier that turns into an infection. That was when it became truly debilitating because I had to go to the emergency room as I did not know what else to do</span>. Then, here, for me, there is <span class="alternatives">emptiness because I take an antibiotic, and the symptoms disappear</span>. But from this point on, when I travel, because it has happened to me while traveling, <span class="recurrences">it becomes a circular thing. It closes and returns</span>. I do not like that I always carry it with me.”

				"I have already admitted that I do not know if I am talking about cystitis or candida. I still have not figured it out. The fact is that I treat it with antibiotics. The symptoms are the ones on the table. I have never had pain and nausea. <span class="nausea">Maybe nausea a few times</span>, but I do not know if it was due to that or to the fact that I was taking antibiotics. That said, for me too, <span class="recurrences">it is kind of an inter-temporal process, but not exactly</span>. <span class="urine">The starting point is incontinence</span>. I already have it on my own. You know I am always there, every time, in the bathroom. But it is <span class="urine">a different incontinence because it causes me pain [1]</span>. The reason for putting foam inside is actually because it is a material that absorbs. It seems to me like a material that holds liquids more than the others on the table. It absorbs and absorbs, but at the same time, it has this sort of chain around it that I simulated with string. This chain tries to contain it and creates these bubbles that become painful. <span class="urine">When the pee that remains, excuse my literary term, is still there, all inside, contained within the soft material that is my genital tract, it comes out and hurts [2]. It becomes sharp, and urinating becomes uncomfortable</span>. The little balls I placed, which we had actually associated with timing, I associated with a sensation that really bothers me. This sensation is linked to what came up during the workshop on leaks. <span class="leaks">These leaks [3] are also socially debilitating for me because they generate a bad odor. I can smell my bad odor</span> when I have candida. <span class="leaks">I perceive myself as having a different smell, and I think those around me perceive it too</span>. So it is not just physical pain but also something that debilitates me socially in my relationships with others. The rubber bands also fit well conceptually. They are not just for the odor. I used them for that because I thought, this stinks, hold it. But also because they close me off and cage me socially. It goes back to my initial symptom description. For me, it is very much about shutting myself off from others. When <span class="recurrences">I am in that state, exposed, and lately, every month or month and a half</span>, I have actually stopped taking antibiotics and switched to probiotics. These were recommended to me and are actually calming the situation a bit. This one, not yet, because it is still the symptom I always have. But I am managing to prevent it from reaching that stage where I am in pain, feel like I smell bad, or have such strong leaks that they make my workday difficult because I constantly feel dirty. But I have learned. I am experimenting with these new treatments that help me. These new treatments help me stay in the first stage, which is still constant because the infection is still ongoing at the moment. But it is an infection that I can manage. Similar to [another participant], I do so through a particular diet. For example, I recently eliminated gluten, and the intensity with which this infection manifests has decreased. And then, of course, hygiene. That is always there, but when you have this kind of problem, you try to be even more attentive.</p>
